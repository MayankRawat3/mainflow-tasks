            <p><b>Adaribariki Seethamma </b> is a lead natural farmer from Pedalabudu village of Araku Mandal, in
                Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> Technology used: </b>Technology used: In 2019 May, pre-monsoon dry sowing was done and 200 kg of
                Ghanajivamrit was applied
                and the soil was ploughed minimally.
                <br>
                <br>
            <p>On 15 May, seeds of white and red rajma, maize, tomato, red gram, ragi and other millets, leafy
                vegetables, and groundnuts were sowed. All the seeds were sown in line after being treating with
                Beejamrit, except groundnut, which was sown separately on the land. Dry grass was used as mulch material
                and soil was sprinkled on it. Thorn-fencing was done to protect the crops from cattle and other animals.
                Dravajivamrit was sprayed every two weeks until the completion of the crop cycle. Neemastra was sprayed
                to protect the crop from the attack of mosquitoes and other pests and prevent the falling of flowers.
                <br>
                <br>

                The crop was monitored carefully throughout all the stages. No land was left fallow in any season and
                the PMDS technique was adopted.
