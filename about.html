        <p>The Organic Farming Association of India (OFAI) was set up by the seniormost members of India’s organic
            farming community in the year 2002. The association was primarily set up to promote organic farming, lobby
            with government agencies and departments to pay more attention to sustainable agriculture, and assist
            farmers using chemicals and pesticides to convert successfully to organic farming methods.
<br>
<br>
            OFAI today remains the only membership-based national association of organic farmers, organic farming
            promoters and green stores. By charter, the President of the association will always be an organic farmer.
            The association ensures gender equality in all its activities. It campaigns actively against the
            introduction of genetically modified organisms and seeds in India’s agriculture.</p>
